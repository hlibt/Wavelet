# Introduction
The following programs within the AWCM directory are numerical algorithms for solving partial 
differential equations. Specifically, the method used is the Adaptive Wavelet Collocation Method. This 
method was contributed to by the efforts cited in the References section. 

# File structure
Currently, the `AWCM/src/` directory contains a number of sub-directories and files necessary for compilation.
The current file structure looks like 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
 |--- awcm.cpp 
 |--- makefile
 |--- global.hpp
 |--- conditions/
      > /conditions.hpp
 |--- interpolation/
      > /scaling_subd.cpp
      > /detail_subd.cpp
      > /lagrInterp.cpp
      > /lagrInterpD1.cpp
      > /lagrInterpD2.cpp
 ```
