\section{A Single-Precision Implementation of the Adaptive Wavelet Collocation Method on GPUs}
    The goal of this effort is to take advantage of the multi-resolution properties of wavelets in order
    to solve partial differential equations on a two-dimensional adaptive grid using single-precision
    graphical processing units. Single-Precision GPU computing offers greater computing speeds compared
    with double precision computing. If an efficient numerical scheme which overcame the issues of
    round-off error using single-precision computing was implemented on GPUs, it could potentially be of
    use in practical engineering applications.
\section{A Moment-of-Fluid Wavelet Collocation Approach for Multi-Phase Flows}
    The AWCM could be combined with a finite volume formulation at the finest grid level, while using 
    the moment-of-fluid method for interface reconstruction.
